                        <p>This Insurance Policy governs the use of the Airpal.ie telemedicine platform
                            ("Airpal", "Platform", "Website") and outlines the insurance responsibilities for
                            all users, including healthcare professionals ("Doctors") and patients ("Patients").
                            By accessing or using the Platform, you acknowledge that you have read, understood,
                            and agree to be bound by this Insurance Policy. Airpal is committed to transparency
                            and ensuring all parties understand their respective responsibilities.
                        </p>
                        <h4>1. Healthcare Professionals' Insurance Responsibility</h4>
                        <p>1.1 Independent Medical Practice: Doctors using Airpal are independent professionals,
                            and Airpal provides a platform for verifying doctors and facilitating communication
                            and telemedicine services between healthcare providers and patients. Airpal does not
                            employ or provide medical services directly.
                        </p>
                        <h5>1.2 Insurance Coverage: </h5>
                        <p>It is the sole responsibility of each Doctor to maintain adequate professional
                            indemnity insurance or medical malpractice insurance that covers all services
                            rendered through Airpal, including telemedicine consultations. Doctors are required
                            to ensure that their insurance policies are current and cover any claims or
                            liabilities arising from their medical services. </p>
                        <h5>1.3 Legal Liability:</h5>
                        <p>Airpal accepts no liability for any medical advice, diagnosis, treatment, or services
                            provided by Doctors on the platform. Doctors acknowledge that they are fully
                            responsible for the medical care they provide, and any claims arising from
                            malpractice, negligence, or failure to meet professional standards are the
                            responsibility of the Doctor.</p>
                        <h4>2. Patients' Insurance Responsibility</h4>
                        <h5>2.1 Direct Payment for Services:</h5>
                        <p>Patients using Airpal to receive medical care from Doctors are responsible for
                            covering the costs of those services. In cases where a patient’s private health
                            insurance policy covers telemedicine consultations, it is the patient's
                            responsibility to seek reimbursement or direct payment from their insurance
                            provider. Airpal does not process insurance claims on behalf of Patients or handle
                            direct insurance billing.</p>
                        <h5>2.2 Insurance Coverage for Payments:</h5>
                        <p>Patients should confirm with their insurer whether telemedicine services are covered
                            under their policy before engaging with Doctors on Airpal. Any failure by a
                            patient’s insurance provider to cover services rendered is the sole responsibility
                            of the patient.</p>
                        <h4>3. Limitation of Liability for Airpal</h4>
                        <h5>3.1 No Medical Liability:</h5>
                        <p>Airpal is a technology platform that facilitates communication between Doctors and
                            Patients. Airpal does not provide medical care, advice, diagnosis, or treatment. All
                            medical services provided via Airpal are performed by independent Doctors. Airpal
                            shall not be liable for any harm, injury, loss, or damage arising from medical
                            services provided by Doctors on the Platform.</p>
                        <h5>3.2 Platform Usage:</h5>
                        <p>While Airpal strives to ensure that the Platform is secure and operational, we do not
                            guarantee the availability, performance, or security of the Website or telemedicine
                            services at all times. Airpal is not liable for any technical issues, data breaches,
                            service interruptions, or other events beyond our control that may affect the usage
                            of the Platform.</p>
                        <h5>3.3 Compliance with Law:</h5>
                        <p>Airpal complies with all relevant regulations and laws concerning data privacy (e.g.,
                            GDPR) and telemedicine. However, Airpal is not responsible for any failure by
                            Doctors to comply with local, national, or international healthcare laws or
                            regulations in relation to telemedicine or medical services provided through the
                            Platform.</p>
                        <h4>4. Dispute Resolution and Governing Law</h4>
                        <h5>4.1 Dispute Resolution:</h5>
                        <p>In the event of a dispute between any users of Airpal (Doctors, Patients, or third
                            parties) concerning medical services or other aspects of the Platform, Airpal is not
                            liable or responsible for resolving such disputes. Doctors and Patients are
                            encouraged to resolve any issues through direct communication or other applicable
                            legal channels.</p>
                        <h5>4.2 Governing Law:</h5>

                            matters shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Ireland.</p>
                        <h4>5. Indemnification</h4>
